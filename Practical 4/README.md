Practical 4 is all about using array and function to calculate area using trapezoidal rule

# trapezoidalV2.c

* trapezoidalV2.c program uses math library for calculating PI, log and tan functions
* TanArr[] array is used to store f(x0),f(x1).......,f(xn)
* function degree_to_radian(deg) is called whenever degree to radian conversion is needed

# findings

* the area calculated using given values is approximately equal to value of log(2) 

# step to run trapezoidalV2.c

* compile using "gcc -o trapezoidalV2 trapezoidalV2.c -lm" 
* execute using "./trapezoidalV2"
